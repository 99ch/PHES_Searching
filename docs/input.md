## Input

### Storage Location
In the home directory of the PHES_Searching folder there should be a file called storage_location. In this file there should be a single line describing the path to the input/output folder in the format “file_storage_location = <path to storage location>;”. For example, to use the same PHES_Searching folder, use “file_storage_location = ../PHES_Searching/;” or for the folder on the pv network drive at ANU use “file_storage_location = ../../../../../p/PHES_Searching/;”.
This location will be referred to as <storage location> hereafter.
To use a network location, first ensure the computer is connected to the server (Can be accessed through windows explorer). Then in either linux bash or ubuntu (either can be installed on a windows computer), mount the server to the p drive using “sudo mount -t drvfs  \\\\piso.cecs.anu.edu.au\\pv /mnt/p/” (Adjust as needed for an alternate system).
### Digital Elevation Model
Place all required DEM files (1 degree by 1 degree with 1 arcsecond resolution supported, other resolutions unknown) in the <storage location>/input/DEMs folder with filename <latitude>_<longitude>_1arc_v3.tif (e.g. n00_e000_1arc_v3.tif).

### Shapefile Exclusions (Filters)
If required, place all shapefile exclusions (filters) in the <storage location>/input folder and add them as filters in the variables file (See below). For faster runtimes on bulk runs, see generating shapefile tiles below.
### Existing Reservoirs
__NOTE: This is only required for brownfield searching, steps below can be ignored for purely off-river searching.__

#### Shapefile
Place the shapefile containing all existing reservoirs to be checked in the <storage location>/input/existing_reservoirs folder and add its filename as the existing_reservoirs_shp in the variables file (See below).
#### CSV Data
Place the csv spreadsheet containing information about the reservoirs to be tested in the <storage location>/input/existing_reservoirs folder and add its filename as the existing_reservoirs_csv in the variables file (See below).
A header row must be present, and columns must match the columns in the image below.

<!-- TODO add image -->

#### Names
Place the spreadsheet containing the reservoir names corresponding to the polygons in the shapefile in the order they occur in the shape files (All polygons must be included, details on generating this file from the dbf are outlined below) in the <storage location>/input/existing_reservoirs folder and add its filename as the existing_reservoirs_shp_names in the variables file (See below).
A header row must be present, and columns must match the columns in the image below.

<!-- TODO add image -->

##### Generating names csv from dbf
The csv with a list of names can be generated by using excel to open the dbf file attached to the shapefile of existing reservoirs, finding the column that corresponds to the name and copy and pasting it into a new file (As seen above).

#### To run
Run pairing both with 
Bin/pairing “RESERVOIR NAME” 1
Bin/pairing <long> <lat> 1

<!-- TODO move to single run -->
